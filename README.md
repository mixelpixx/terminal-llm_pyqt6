# terminal-llm
Trying to create simple LLM interface to lower the entry barrier to this stuff.

TODO ELI5 LLMs and Local LLMs.

## How to use?






## New GUI Features
The application now features a graphical user interface built with PyQt6. You can interact with the LLM chat, create files and ideas, load and delete ideas, and list available ideas all through a user-friendly interface.
